## Reinforcement learning

Learning by doing, Sort of a trial and error method.This sort of learning is used for training AI into something we humans are pretty good at but don't fully understand about that particular skill.For example we humans are pretty good at walking but trying to explain the process of walking is kind of difficult, think about it.

There are two types of learning:

- Supervised learning: where a teacher gives the answer to ai to learn from.
- Unsupervised learning: where ai finds the answer on its own through patterns.
