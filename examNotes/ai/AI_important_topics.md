## Reinforcement learning

Learning by doing, Sort of a trial and error method.This sort of learning is used for training AI into something we humans are pretty good at but don't fully understand about that particular skill.For example we humans are pretty good at walking but trying to explain the process of walking is kind of difficult, think about it.

So basically it is a form of learning in an enviornment through feedback from an AI's behaviour.

There are two types of learning:

- Supervised learning: where a teacher gives the answer to ai to learn from.
- Unsupervised learning: where ai finds the answer on its own through patterns.

## Gradient descent

At a theoretical level, gradient descent is an algorithm that minimizes functions. Given a function defined by a set of parameters, gradient descent starts with an initial set of parameter values and iteratively moves toward a set of parameter values that minimize the function. This iterative minimization is achieved using calculus, taking steps in the negative direction of the functionÂ gradient

## Bias and variance

The inablitiy of ml method to capture true relationship of the data sets is called bias.
The difference in fits between data sets is called variance.
