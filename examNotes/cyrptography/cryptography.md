# Cryptography

Letâ€™s review some terminology:

- **Cryptographic Algorithm or Cipher**: This algorithm defines the encryption and decryption processes.
- **Key**: The cryptographic algorithm needs a key to convert the plaintext into ciphertext and vice versa.
- Plaintext is the original message that we want to encrypt
- Ciphertext is the message in its encrypted form
