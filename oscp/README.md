# OSCP Notes

The course first focuses on basic linux commands and navigation using command line.
I'll just put some important ones on here and then we'll move onto the pentesting section of this course because that is honestly the only thing I am excited about.

* With `ps` command you can see the current processes
* With `kill` command you can kill a pariticular process.
* With `wget` command you can download a file from a remote web browser
* With `curl` command you can download manipulate http requests and modify them on the go


# Customizing the bash enviornment 
*Alias* is a string we can define which can replace the command name. By doing 
```bash
alias lsa="ls -la"
```
We can define lsa as ls -la.
