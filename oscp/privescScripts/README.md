## Enumaration

- ```hostname```

- ```uname -a```

- ```cat /proc/version```

- ```cat /etc/passwd```

- ```env```

- ```history```


To get a nice wordlist which will help you in bruteforcing for other user accounts you can cut /etc/passwd file to reduce the noise 

```cat /etc/passwd | cut -d ":" -f 1```

# Tactics

## kernel exploits 
Privilege escalation ideally leads to root privileges. This can sometimes be achieved simply by exploiting an existing vulnerability, or in some cases by accessing another user account that has more privileges, information, or access.


The Kernel exploit methodology is simple;

* Identify the kernel version
* Search and find an exploit code for the kernel version of the target system
* Run the exploit


Most of the cves can be found in [linux exploit cves]( https://www.linuxkernelcves.com/cves )


## Privilege Escalation: Sudo services
Any user can check its current situation related to root privileges using the ```sudo -l``` command.
[GFTOBINS](https://gtfobins.github.io/) is a valuable source that provides information on how any program, on which you may have sudo rights, can be used.

<<<<<<< HEAD:oscp/privescScripts/README.md
## SUID and GUID files
The first step in Linux privilege escalation exploitation is to check for files with the SUID/GUID bit set. This means that the file or files can be run with the permissions of the file(s) owner/group.
Finding suid binaries

```bash
find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
```

find - Initiates the "find" command

/ - Searches the whole file system

-perm - searches for files with specific permissions

-u=s - Any of the permission bits mode are set for the file. Symbolic modes are accepted in this form

-type f - Only search for files

2>/dev/null - Suppresses errors


## Exploiting a writable /etc/passwd

Understanding /etc/passwd

The /etc/passwd file stores essential information, which  is required during login. In other words, it stores user account information. The /etc/passwd is a plain text file. It contains a list of the systemâ€™s accounts, giving for each account some useful information like user ID, group ID, home directory, shell, and more.

It's simple really, if we have a writable /etc/passwd file, we can write a new line entry according to the above formula and create a new user! We add the password hash of our choice, and set the UID, GID and shell to root. Allowing us to log in as our own root user!

==================

# Windows

Depending on the situation, we might need to abuse some of the following weaknesses:

- Misconfigurations on Windows services or scheduled tasks
- Excessive privileges assigned to our account
- Vulnerable software
- Missing Windows security patches

Windows Users

- Administrative user
- Standard User

## Harvesting passwords from usual spots
The easiest way to gain access to another user is to gather credentials from a compromised machine.

## Powershell history

Whenever a user runs a command using Powershell, it gets stored into a file that keeps a memory of past commands

```cmd
type %userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadline\ConsoleHost_history.txt
```

## Saved Windows Credentials

Windows allows us to use other users' credentials. This function also gives the option to save these credentials on the system. The command below will list saved credentials:
```cmd
cmdkey /list
```

While you can't see the actual passwords, if you notice any credentials worth trying, you can use them with the runas command and the /savecred option, as seen below.
```cmd
runas /savecred /user:admin cmd.exe
```


## IIS configuration
Internet Information Services (IIS) is the default web server on Windows installations. The configuration of websites on IIS is stored in a file called web.config and can store passwords for databases or configured authentication mechanisms.Here is a quick way to find database connection strings on the file:

```cmd
type C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\Config\web.config | findstr connectionString
```


## Retrieve Credentials from Software: PuTTY

PuTTY is an SSH client commonly found on Windows systems. Instead of having to specify a connection's parameters every single time, users can store sessions where the IP, user and other configurations can be stored for later use. While PuTTY won't allow users to store their SSH password, it will store proxy configurations that include cleartext authentication credentials.

To retrieve proxy info: 
```cmd
reg query HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\SimonTatham\PuTTY\Sessions\ /f "Proxy" /s
```

## Sheduled Tasks

You can check sheduled tasks with the help of command 
```cmd
