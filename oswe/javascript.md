# Just some randome notes about javascript

## Exectution context
A wrapper that manages the code that is running
Base execution context is the goblal context 
Whenever your code is run, js engine creates two things for you **Global object** and **"this"**.

GLOBAL just means not inside the function

It is divided into some phases
1) Creation phase : Along with the global object and this, the execution context also creates a memory space for variables and fuctions and this is also called hoisting. 

## Object
Just a collection of name value pairs

## Hoisting
Like i said along with the global object and this, the execution context also creates a memory space for variables and fuctions and this is also called hoisting.

## Scope
Where a variable is available in your code.

## Synchronous
One line at a time.

## Asynchronous callbacks
it just simply means more than one at a time.
