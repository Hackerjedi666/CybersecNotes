# Buisiness logic vulenrablities


These type of vulnerability are also called logic flaws in which developer fail to think of all the test cases in which a user can control the functionality of sending data.
These vulnerability are mostly found accidently, most of the time a hacker is not even looking for them and there is a wide variety of bugs in this category which can be quite dangerous or not harmful at all.


# Examples

As i said there is a wide variety of these vulnerabilities but these are the most common

 Examples of logic flaws include:

Excessive trust in client-side controls 
Failing to handle unconventional input 
Making flawed assumptions about user behavior 
Domain-specific flaws 
Providing an encryption oracle 


# Excessive Trust

The fundamental flawed assumption of a developer is that the user is gonna be interacting with the web applicaiton with web interface. Me as a hacker can use Proxy like burpsuite and easily rendering the client side validation useless.
