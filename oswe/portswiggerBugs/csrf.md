## Csrf vulnerabilities
Getting the user to some actions which they doesn't wanna do like change their email or password lol.

Some ways to prevent this 

- **csrf tokens**; Everytime a form is filled its request is sent with this token and chages with every request but can be bypassed if not implmented properly

- **same site restriction**;
