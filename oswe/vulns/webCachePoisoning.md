# WEB Cache

It is the data which normally web servers store for users so that later on when users come back they will be able to surf the web more quickly.It sits in between the user and backend server so that whenever same content is requested user won't have to communicate with backend server again and again.


# WEB cachepoison

Since the webserver is storing the data, a hacker can use this feature to try adding malicious content which will look like legit content to web servers. Then if regular users come to website they will be served that malicious content by web server.
