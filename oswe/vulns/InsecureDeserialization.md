# Serialization and Deserialization

Serialization refers to turning complex object into easy readable format and deserialization is just the opposite of it.

There are many languages which support serializaiton and deserializations.
TIP: if you r00AB in the staritng of the base64 code you can fairly assume it is a java serialized object


We can check the files about serializatin by running basic "file" command in linux

We can use serialization for many purposes, in web security we can use it for authenticatoin of session cookies, 
communicatoin between client and a server etc.

We can chain insecure deserialization which can lead to even RCE.

In python pickle module is used for serialization.
