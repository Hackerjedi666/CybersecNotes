# Binary exploitation

## Exploiation checklist for Bufferoverflow

* Crash or overlfow the program
* Find out how many bytes it took to crash the program. (EIP offset)
* Confirm the offset with EIP "overwrite".
* Use/Create some kind of shellcode to exploit the program. (not advisable if NX(no execute) or DEP (Data excution prevention) if present).

## EIP register

It hold the address of the function or anything that is being executed currently.

Think of it as litrally a finger telling the cpu what is going to be running.
