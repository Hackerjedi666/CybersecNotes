# Command and Control Center

This is basically a threaded server for reverse shells. It is really useful in session management in the post exploitation phase.


# Structure of C2 Server

It consists of three things:

- **Agents/Payloads**:An agent is a program generated by the C2 framework that calls back to a listener on a C2 server

- **Listeners**: On the most basic level, a listener is an application running on the C2 server that waits for a callback over a specific port or protocol.

- **Beacons**: A Beacon is the process of a C2 Agent calling back to the listener running on a C2 Server.

# Payload Formats
Some C2 Frameworks support payloads in various other formats, for example:

* PowerShell Scripts
* Which may contain C# Code and may be compiled and executed with the Add-Type commandlet
* HTA Files
* JScript Files
* Visual Basic Application/Scripts
* Microsoft Office Documents
