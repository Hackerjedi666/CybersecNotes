These notes are gonna be about source review, Basically whiteBox Testing

Just some important pointer and notes which might help me in future.

The CirclekFramework:

1) Application Review
2) Take Notes about everything eg. tech stacks, Behaviour profile etc.
3) Map the applicaiton
4) Brainstorm the risks of the application
5) Build list of review items in the notest itself
6) Perform all the reviews one by one



Behavior Profile
• What does it do? (business purpose)
• Who does it do this for? (internal / external customer base)
• What kind of information will it hold?
• What are the different types of roles?
• What aspects concern your client/customer/staff the most?
