## Cpu architecture

Each cpu has its own instruction set format (ISA).

Cpu instruction are written in hex format and because of that it is very difficult to read. As a result machine code is translated to assembly language.


There are different types of assembly language (the only difference is syntax).

X86 is mainly used in intel and amd processors. 

ARM assembly is used arm processors.

Registers are small, high speed storage locations within the cpu used to store data temporariliy.
